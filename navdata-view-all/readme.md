## Concept
Be able to view all of Pete's NaData all in one place all at the same time.

See if you can get to zoom level 1 and rotate the earth.


## Features

* View 12K+ items
* The app shows the data in three ways: 1. as raw JSON data, 2. as parsed data and 3. as 3D data 
* The elevation of every airport is scaled to its actual height

## Road Map
This app is an experiment in locating places acording to latitude, longitude and altitude - all with the minimum amount of code. 
R1 has a projection error. R2 will fix.

This app was built just for fun. It plays with the issue of how do you show thousands of things. In this instance the airports become ground cover.

## Issues /Bugs

* Not happy about crossing International Date Line
* Latitudes outside of the top row of tiles have a projection error and are elongated

## Project Links

You have two ways of viewing the FGx files:

* Code hosted on GitHub: [fgx.github.io]( http://fgx.github.io/fgx-airports/navdata-view-all/ "view the files as apps." ) <input value="<< You are now probably here." size=28 style="font:bold 12pt monospace;border-width:0;" >  
* Source code on GitHub: [github.com/fgx]( https://github.com/fgx/fgx-airports/tree/gh-pages/navdata-view-all "View the files as source code." ) <scan style=display:none ><< You are now probably here.</scan>
