[FGX NavData View All]( http://fgx.github.io/fgx-airports/navdata-view-all/latest/index.html )

* Current latest: R3
* Adds selecting data via the NavData bounding box feature
* Add some interesting user experience / data viz features

## Concept
Be able to view  - all of Pete's [NavData]( http://navdata.fgx.ch/ ) - all in one place - all at the same time.

There's over 27,000 items in the database

See if you can get to zoom level 1 and rotate the earth. If so, you have a great computer or you are very ptient.


## Features

* View 12K+ items
* Set the zoom level from 0 to 18. Zoom, pan and rotate with your pointing device.
* Select a new ocation to view using a gazetteer with over 2K locations
* The app shows the data in three ways: 1. as raw JSON data, 2. as parsed data and 3. as 3D data 
* The elevation of every airport or item with elevation is scaled to its actual height
* Items with no elevation data are displayed under the terrin

## Road Map
This app is an experiment in locating places according to latitude, longitude and altitude - all with the minimum amount of code. 

This app was built just for fun. It plays with the issue of how do you show thousands of things. In this instance the airports become ground cover.

## Issues /Bugs

* The app is not happy about crossing International Date Line

## Project Links
