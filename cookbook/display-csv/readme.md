## Concept
To show as many things in 3D as possible all at once and still have the data for each thing instantly available 


## Features

* Reads 274,954 records from eigt ASCII CSV files
* The entire X-Plane / FlightGear database
* Displays it all in 3D all at once
* Loads in seconds
* Rotate, pan and zoom at 60 FPS
* 'Nearby' data displayed in real-time 

## Road Map

* Better display of ASCII data


## Issues /Bugs

* Needs prettifying
* Color types being assgned innapropriately
* Colors do not update as you move close to the object
