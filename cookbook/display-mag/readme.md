### Live Demo

[Display Mag R1](  http://fgx.github.io/fgx-airports/cookbook/display-mag/latest/index.html)


## Concept
Display the declination of the magnetism of the earth of its entire surface at a variety of alitudes

## Features
Displays well over the surface of the globe
Display well the diffs over the altitudes


## Road Map
Some invent some kind of augmented physics such that the changes in relative declination over time are visible to the human eye and perceptible by the brain. 

## Issues /Bugs
Very slow because demo uses 3D boxes as the pointers.  
Need to use particles instead
Also do not erase and redraw each frme
